### Goal

The goal for this project is to create a game of Tic-Tac-Toe with 2 players. The game is played by giving coordinates
and after each turn the field is updated and printed. After the game is done, that is there is a winner or there are no
more moves, the program prints the state, which is the winner or draw.

### Goal

This goal for this project is to create a simple text based application that helps a cinema. With this program it is
possible to first enter the amount of rows and how many seats a row at. From this starting point it is possible to
either buy a ticket, see the available seats or the sale statistics. When you exit the application it will no longer
hold the data entered before.
